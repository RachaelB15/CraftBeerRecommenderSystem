## Authors: Rachael Burris, Melanie Tran, Emily Luskind
Final project presented to Arnab Bose for the Summer 2021-Machine Learning Final Project at University of Chicago within the Master's of Science in Data Analytics Program.

## Description: 
Beer is the largest alcoholic drink segment compared to cider, hard seltzer, spirits, and wine and currently has a market valued at $94B USD1.
Craft beer is produced by a  craft brewery or microbrewery which typically produces small amounts of beer, typically less than large breweries, and is often independently owned. Craft beer makes up 24% of the beer market revenue at $22.2B USD1. 

In this project, we'll explore various collaborative filtering based recommender systems that would help increase market share and product popularity amongst consumers for ecommerce companies in the the craft beer industry.

## Quickstart Guide
file: 'PytorchRecommenderSystem'  
this .py file contains the code for the following:
  1. obtaining the craft beer review data from Data.World
  2. performing exploratory analysis
  3. defining functions for creating, training, using, and evaluating a collaborative filtering recommender system model using Pytorch libraries

file: 'user-item-table.csv'
this file contains the output of the table created in the .py file above, where we find the cosine similarity between user-item reviews.
